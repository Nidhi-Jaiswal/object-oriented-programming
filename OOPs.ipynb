        "\n",
        "ANS:Polymorphism in Python, especially when combined with inheritance, allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass while retaining their individual behaviors. This concept is fundamental in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and allows for dynamic method overriding and method dispatching, making it easier to work with a variety of object types in a flexible and scalable way.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism in Python is typically achieved through method overriding in the context of inheritance. Inheritance allows a subclass to inherit methods and attributes from a parent class, and polymorphism occurs when a subclass redefines (overrides) a method of the parent class. This means that even though the subclass inherits from the parent class, it can implement its own version of the inherited method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how polymorphism works with inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "Base Class (Parent Class): The parent class provides a method, but it doesn't specify the exact behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Child Class (Subclass): The child class inherits from the parent class and overrides the parent method to provide a different implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Method Call: When the method is called on an object, Python will use the method that corresponds to the actual object's type, not the reference type (which may be a reference to the parent class)."

        "\n",
        "ANS:Method chaining in Python (and in object-oriented programming in general) is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line of code. This is made possible because each method in the chain returns the object itself (or another object of the same type), allowing successive method calls to be performed without the need to re-reference the object."

        "\n",
        "This is a special method, also known as a magic method or dunder method (__call__ stands for \"double underscore call\"). By defining this method in a class, you make its instances callable, enabling more flexible and dynamic behavior in your objects."
